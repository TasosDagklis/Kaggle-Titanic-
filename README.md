# Titanic- Machine Learning from Disaster
This is the legendary Titanic ML competition in Kaggle. The Titanic Problem is based on the sinking of the ‘Unsinkable’ ship Titanic in the early 1912. 
It gives you information about multiple people like their ages, sexes, sibling counts, embarkment points and whether or not they survived the disaster. 
Based on these features, you have to predict if an arbitrary passenger on Titanic would survive the sinking.
